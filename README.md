*********ELK STACK***************  <br/>
The ELK stack consists of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Although they've all been built to work exceptionally well together, each one is a separate project that is driven by the open-source vendor Elasticâ€”which itself began as an enterprise search platform vendor. It has now become a full-service analytics software company, mainly because of the success of the ELK stack.
