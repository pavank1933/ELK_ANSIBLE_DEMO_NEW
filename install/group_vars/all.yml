# ELK Server Variables
########################################
### FIREWALL MANAGEMENT ###
# By default we will enable firewall management, this
# will ensure if you're using either firewalld or iptables-services
# that the proper service rules are applied and any existing rulesets
# are saved.
# DEFAULT: true
# TO DISABLE: set to empty or false
# NOTE: if you disable this you'll need to make sure you open up
# equivalent firewall ports below or turn it off entirely (not recommended)
# even if you leave firewall rules off you can safely leave this enabled
# as the current firewall code will detect this and leave it alone.
# if you really, really want to disable checking/applying service firewall rules
# then change to 'false' or empty
manage_firewall: true

### nginx ###
# add nonstandard port here for undercloud usage
# note: you should use nonstandard ports for both here
# if you choose to do this.
#
# usage: port nginx listens to reverse-proxy Kibana
# default is 80
# e.g. 8888
nginx_kibana_port: 80
#
# usage: port filebeat client grabs the client SSL certificate
# default is 8080
# e.g. 9999
elk_server_ssl_cert_port: 8080
#
# Kibana options
# change this to affect nginx-wrapped htpasswd authentication
kibana_user: admin
kibana_password: admin

### logging backend ###
# you can pick between logstash or fluentd
# if left empty logstash will be used
### accepted options ###
# logging_backend:
# logging_backend: logstash
# logging_backend: fluentd
logging_backend:
#
### logstash options ###
logstash_syslog_port: 5044
logstash_localsyslog_port: 5000
### rsyslog options

### fluentd options ###
fluentd_syslog_port: 42185
fluentd_http_port: 9919
fluentd_debug_port: 24230
## elasticsearch local port listener
# general usage will not need elasticsearch listening
# outside of localhost, if you want to apply firewall rules
# to allow external connections to elasticsearch change the below setting
# to true
# we will set this to false by default
es_local_port: 9200
es_listen_external: false
### install curator tool ###

install_curator_tool: false
## X-PACK
# This installs an additional suite of tools from elastic
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/x-pack/current/xpack-introduction.html
# note: X-Pack will wrap ES with additional authentication, I do not
# configure this for you, only install it.
# most people will not need this for basic ELK usage.
# default login/pass to Kibana for example is:
# username: elastic
# password: changeme
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS UNLESS YOU CHANGE IT ON ES
xpack_elastic_user_password: changeme
# install elastic x-pack
install_elasticsearch_xpack: false
# install kibana x-pack
